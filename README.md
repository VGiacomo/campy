This is a proof-of-concept project.
Campy is a social networking platform designed exclusively for the camping community.
It offers a rich array of features aimed at enhancing campers' experiences by facilitating connections, sharing resources, finding help for chores, borrowing items, and organizing outdoor activities.
With Campy, the beauty of camping meets the convenience of modern technology.

It's built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/).
Connected to Firebase for authentication and storage.
